# pipeline research:
## Questions
- how are we going to scrape the data
- how are we going to manipulate the data to send it to the calsification algorithm 

## Ingestion points 
- Where we collect data
    - data warehouses
    - relational databases
	- web analytics
	- Bla bla bla
- Ways we collect data
	- **Batches** (using a set time as the trigger to send)
	- **streaming** (uses other trigger such as sensors in a factory)

## Data Transformation Functions
- Extraction and Parsing
	- Get the data that we actually need and compatible with the system
- Filtering and Mapping
	- Remap different names for the same places to be the same place
		- ( Bangkok, กทม, กรุงเทพ, etc)
	- filter what data you want to use in the system
		- some data might be incomplete or you only want to a just some part of the data set

## Data Enrichment
- combines other sources of data for a better, more representative, database
- Use other sourse to build a **bigger** picture in the database
## Cross-Rocord Correlation
		-
